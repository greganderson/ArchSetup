Notes:
  - Install Gnome (Mate?) after installing intel driver to get desktop managers to work
  - Install xscreensaver
    + This goes in ~/.xinitrc:
        xscreensaver-command -exit
        xscreensaver &
        exec mate-session

  - Install gvim, not vim.  This comes with more features.  Use vim, of course.
  - NetworkManager is the main one, get network-manager-applet for the icon in the taskbar
    + Use this site if things are messed up:
      - http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/65255/networkmanager-issues-in-arch-linux
  - Note: Chromium CANNOT be run as root.  It probably works, just run as a normal user.
  - Use this script to sleep, I haven't figured out how to trigger it on closing the lid:
      #!/bin/bash
      xscreensaver-command --lock
      systemctl suspend

	Network Time Protocol Daemon
		- Install ntp 
		- systemctl start ntpd.service

	- Install yaourt
	- Clone your ArchScripts repo
